# Hello!
I am Alper, an English Language and Literature student at Ege University, interesed in software development.

I am mostly interested in Python and Front-end development.

As a *self-taught* coder, I try to get better at technologies that I am interested in by taking online courses 📚 and building projects 👨‍💻

One of my favorite projects that I developed is [Daily Space Palette](https://github.com/yethranayeh/daily-space-palette), a simple web project that fetches the Astronomy Picture of the Day using NASA's API, then generates a color palette from that picture.

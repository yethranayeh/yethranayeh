# Hello 👋
I am Alper, an English Language and Literature graduate 📚 currently working at Etstur as a Frontend Developer 💻
As a self-taught developer, I try to get better at technologies that I am interested in by building small hobby projects in my free time 👨‍💻

  <br/>
  Exalt Rates is a Path of Exile 2 currency calculator that lets you quickly and easily convert one currency to another.

  (<a href="https://github.com/yethranayeh/daily-space-palette" target="_blank">Repo</a>)
  <br/>
  One of my favorite projects that I developed is Daily Space Palette, a simple web project that fetches the Astronomy Picture of the Day using NASA's API, then generates a color palette from that picture's colors.

  (<a href="https://github.com/yethranayeh/ideaList" target="_blank">Repo</a>)
  <br/>
  IdeaList is a to-do list web application that is designed with a mobile first approach 📱
  <br/>
  It was the first "completed" project I had built while learning JavaScript from YouTube videos. With the knowledge and experience I had at the time, I think it still came out pretty well. It also works as a PWA! So, you can add it to your home screen on your phone and use it in standalone mode like a native app!

# Hello 👋
I am Alper, a 23 year old English Language and Literature 📚 student interested in software development 💻. I find coding to be a great way to turn my ideas into functional and useful realities.

I am particularly interested in working with ⚛ React to create fast, dynamic and intuitive web pages.

I also have some experience using Python. Specifically in web-scraping (Selenium), desktop apps (PyQt), back-end development (Django) and database management applications (PostgreSQL, SQLite, MongoDB). 

As a self-taught developer, I try to get better at technologies that I am interested in by taking online courses 📚 and building projects 👨‍💻

  Weather App is a React application that I built using OpenWeatherMap API. It can display weather based on geolocation or user's search query.

  One of my favorite projects that I developed is Daily Space Palette, a simple web project that fetches the Astronomy Picture of the Day using NASA's API, then generates a color palette from that picture's colors.

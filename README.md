# Hello!
I am Alper, a 22 year old English Language and Literature 📚 student interested in software development 💻. Coding is a great way to turn ideas into functional, useful and tangible realities.

I am particularly knowledgeable about Python, with intermediate self-taught experience in web-scraping, back-end development and database management applications (PostgreSQL, SQLite, MongoDB). 

I also have experience working on Front-end projects professionally and as a hobby.

As a *self-taught* developer, I try to get better at technologies that I am interested in by taking online courses 📚 and building projects 👨‍💻

[ideaList](https://yethranayeh.github.io/ideaList/) ([GH](https://github.com/yethranayeh/ideaList)) is one of my portfolio projects that I am really passionate about. It is a to-do list progressive web application that is designed with a mobile first approach 📱

One of my favorite projects that I developed is [Daily Space Palette](https://yethranayeh.github.io/daily-space-palette/), a simple web project that fetches the Astronomy Picture of the Day using NASA's API, then generates a color palette from that picture.

I have also built a [Tic-Tac-Toe](https://yethranayeh.github.io/tic-tac-toe/) game that can be played against a computer or another person:

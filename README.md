# Hello!
I am Alper, a 23 year old English Language and Literature 📚 student interested in software development 💻. I find coding to be a great way to turn my ideas into functional, useful and tangible realities.

I am particularly interested in working with ReactJS to create fast, dynamic and intuitive web pages.

I also have some experience using Python. Especially in web-scraping (Selenium), desktop apps (PyQt), back-end development (Django) and database management applications (PostgreSQL, SQLite, MongoDB). 

As a *self-taught* developer, I try to get better at technologies that I am interested in by taking online courses 📚 and building projects 👨‍💻

[ideaList](https://yethranayeh.github.io/ideaList/) ([GH](https://github.com/yethranayeh/ideaList)) is one of my portfolio projects that I am really passionate about. It is a to-do list progressive web application that is designed with a mobile first approach 📱

One of my favorite projects that I developed is [Daily Space Palette](https://yethranayeh.github.io/daily-space-palette/), a simple web project that fetches the Astronomy Picture of the Day using NASA's API, then generates a color palette from that picture.

I have also built a [Tic-Tac-Toe](https://yethranayeh.github.io/tic-tac-toe/) game that can be played against a computer or another person:
